# My Blog
This blog is here to detail parts of my life that I wish to share.
## Here is some info about me and my day as a normal human male:
* Wake up at a normal hour of 3am.
* Try to go back to sleep and fail completely.
* Continue to stare at the wall until the sun comes up.
* Quickly put on my human suit before the wife notices. _she doesn't supect a thing_.
